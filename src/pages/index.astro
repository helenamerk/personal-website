    <h1>Helena Merk</h1>

    <p>I'm focused on creating systems-level change that helps people and planet thrive. Right now, I'm building <a href="https://streamlineclimate.com">Streamline</a>, a platform to simplify how organizations access government funding for critical infrastructure and climate work.</p>

    <h2>My Story</h2>

    <p>I moved to the U.S. as a kid from Europe—my parents were chasing the American dream. We landed in the Bay Area because of the Finnish and German communities that made the transition easier. Much of my childhood was split between two extremes: summers spent in the deep forests of northern Finland, surrounded by lakes and silence—and the rest of the year in Palo Alto, California, where tech giants were exploding overnight.</p>

    <p>Growing up in that environment teaches you to dream big and live with an abundance mindset. It also comes at a cost. Palo Alto became known not just for startups, but for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/05/10/405694832/in-palo-altos-high-pressure-schools-suicides-lead-to-soul-searching">leading the nation in teen suicides</a>. I experienced this firsthand. The pressure-cooker environment devastated the mental health of many of my peers—and my own. That experience shaped how I think about ambition, resilience, and what it means to build a healthy culture.</p>

    <p>I taught myself to code when I was 12, around the time the iPhone first launched. My dad made a deal: I could use his new iPhone only if I was productive and built an app for the newly released App Store. He meant it as a joke, but I ran with it—software felt like a magical key to impact at scale. I spent the next few years building projects, sneaking into collegiate hackathons, and eventually working full-time at a Series B startup while still in high school.</p>

    <p>Fast forward a few years, and I decided to start my first company. A friend and I were accepted into Y Combinator's Winter 2020 batch, where we built Glimpse to combat the loneliness epidemic during COVID. While working on Glimpse, I started to have sleepless nights thinking and researching the climate crisis. It was impossible to ignore. I knew I had to pivot my career to focus on environmental solutions—so I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/10/remote-work-and-events-startup-twine-acquires-yc-backed-glimpse-to-launch-on-zoom/">sold Glimpse</a> and went all in on climate.</p>

    <h2>Community</h2>

    <p>I love creating spaces for connection—whether it's through thoughtful events, public talks, or late-night discussions that stretch how we think about impact.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I've hosted dozens of gatherings that bring together climate leaders, researchers, and entrepreneurs—from intentional dinners and retreats to larger convenings and hackathons, like the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/helenamerk_climatetech-permitting-grantwriting-activity-7071521758641586177-xXMA">Climate AI Hackathon</a>, co-hosted with OpenAI and Lowercarbon. I also co-founded a climate-focused living community in San Francisco that serves as a hub for founders building environmental solutions. If you're interested in thoughtful event design, I highly recommend The Art of Gathering by Priya Parker.</p>

    <p>Beyond gatherings, I've spoken on panels and delivered talks on topics like climate tech, startup leadership, imposter syndrome, and building for systems-level impact. One recorded talk is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXq50gPo-go">this keynote at OpenAI's Dev Day</a>, where I shared thoughts on how AI can accelerate climate action.</p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>

    <p>I was lucky early in my career—people took bets on me before I felt ready. They gave me real responsibility, challenged my assumptions, and encouraged me to dream bigger. That experience left a mark. As I became a founder and leader, I often found myself asking: How can I be the kind of leader younger me was lucky to have?</p>

    <p>I believe in setting high bars and building the scaffolding to help people stretch into them. I believe in challenging each other with care and giving people space to surprise themselves. Leadership isn't about being the smartest in the room—it's about building the kind of room where everyone is leveling up.</p>

    <p>At Streamline, we've built a culture around the core principles below-- but I find they apply far beyond Streamline and I apply to my own life consistently:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Challenge with Love</strong> – The best ideas are pressure-tested with care and respect.</li>
      <li><strong>Raise the Bar</strong> – The last 1% separates good from great.</li>
      <li><strong>Work Hard, Sleep Hard</strong> – High performance means serious rest, too.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Responsibly</strong> – Technology shapes the climate transition. "Don't be evil" isn't enough—we need to be good.</li>
      <li><strong>Disco Snails</strong> – The best work feels like play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bikes</h2>

    <p>I ride bikes—mostly in San Francisco and Marin and race across the US. It helps me incorporate play into adulthood. If you're in the area and want to join a training ride (or a coffee spin), reach out! I race with Team Monarch, and you can find my routes and rides on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/98684372">Strava</a>.</p>
